			<p> Several years ago plain, black and white text was suitable for a webspage on a website.  Over time, as the Internet grew, programmers developed different ways to incorporate ways to personalize the text to make a more noticable.
			<p>Some of these include:
				<u1>
					<li>Font Size</li>
					<li>Font Sytles</li>
					<li>Alignments</li>
					<li>Hyperlinks</li>
					<li>Pictures</li>
					<li>Tables</li>
				</ui>
			<hr>
			<br>
			<p>Font on a website can be written in different sizes, for example : <h1>big font</h1> or <h6> small font </h6></p>
			<hr>
			<p> Another way of stylizing the text is the way the text is written on the screen. Here are some examples : <br>
			<br><b>This is BOLD Text</b>
			<br>
			<br><i>This is Italics Text</i>
			<br>
			<br><u>This is Underline Text</u>
			<br>
			<font color = "blue">This text is Blue</font> 
			<br>
			<br>You can even <del> strikethrough</del>Text
			<hr>
			<p> In addition to the style of the text, there is also ways to format the arragement of the text. Here are some examples : <br>
			<br>
			<p align = "left"> This text is align to the left.
			<br>
			<center>This text is Centered</center>
			<br>
			<p align = "right"> This text is align to the right.<br>
			<hr>
			<p>Hyperlinks are a special type of text that when a user clicks on it, the text will send the user to another website or to a dfferent part of the webpage. Here are some examples:</p><br>

			<br>
			<a href="http://www.saxifrageschool.org" title = "Saxifrage School">Saxifrage School </a>
			<br>
			<br>
			Heres the link for the  <a href="http://www.saxifrageschool.org"> Saxifrage School</a> for you to click on.<br>
			<br>
			Heres a link to an email address <a href="mailto:example@saxifrageschool.org">Email the School</a><br>
			<br>
			<hr>
			Rather than having text on a webpage, you can also have pictures. Here is a example: <br>
			<br>
			<img src = "http://i.imgur.com/SFZQU.jpg" heigth = "50" width = "100" alt = "Here is the picture"/><br>
			<br>
			<hr>
			<p> A better way to understand data is to put the data in a table to orgainze it. Heres an example of a table<p>
		<br>
<table border="1" width ="50%" cellpadding = "4" cellspace ="3">
  <tr title="You are looking at Row 1" bgcolor="blue" >
    <TH COLSPAN="2"<br><h3>Table Title</h3>
    </th>
   </TR>
    <th>Row 1 Cell 1</td>
    <th>Row 1 Cell 2</td>
   </tr>
   <TR Align = "center">
   <tr title="You are looking at Row 2" bgcolor="green">
   	 <TH COLSPAN = "2"
    <td>Row 2 Cell 1</td>
    <td>Row 2 Cell 2</td>
  </tr>
</table>
