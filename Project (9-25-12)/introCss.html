		<p><center>Once uopn a time, there was a raccoon named Eric who lived in a peaceful town. A peaceful town where everyone knew everybody, little to no crime, and everybody had a helping hand to give.  Raccon had a successful job as a chef at a local resturant.  Eric was never late, he would open the resturant or even stay late and help close. He would never called off and when a co worker was sick, Eric was more than happy to pick the shift.  
		Every thing was going fine until recently, when Eric surprisely started eating all the food at the job.</center>

		<P>"Raccon!!!" said the Manager. How am I going make any money if you keep on eating all the food?  How about you take off a couple days and think about your choices and allow me regain the monies that I have lost."

		<P>Raccoon didnt know what to think so he just went home and sat down on the couch, thinking.......

		<p> Eric thought to himself, since I have a couple days off, I need to get my mind off of work. I have been eating junk food last cuple days - I want to make me a feast. Theres the store I always love to go to  - that store has all the healthy foods and a low price. Or should I go to the playground and play with my buddies and see if Emily is there? :
