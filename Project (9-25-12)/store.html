				<hr>
				<br>
				Now that I have decided go to the store, I can either walk there or I can drive there by car.  If i walk there, I can save money and so I can buy more groceries but it will take later. But if i drive there i can get there faster but have to spend money on gas.  "Should I go to the local market to save money by walking or should I go to the Super Market to get there faster by car?"
